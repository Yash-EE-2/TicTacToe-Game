## How to Play

1. Open the game in a browser.
2. Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns clicking on empty cells.
3. The first player to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
5. Click the **Restart** button to play again.
